    <h1>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</h1>

    <p>
        Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scalesâ€”typically atomic and subatomic scales.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Concepts in Quantum Mechanics</h2>

    <h3>1. Wave-Particle Duality</h3>
    <p>
        One of the central concepts of quantum mechanics is the wave-particle duality, which suggests that particles such as electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on how they are observed.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Superposition</h3>
    <p>
        Superposition is the principle that quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed or measured, at which point they "collapse" into one of the possible states.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Quantum Entanglement</h3>
    <p>
        Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Uncertainty Principle</h3>
    <p>
        The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the precise position and momentum of a particle. The more precisely one property is known, the less precisely the other can be determined.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications of Quantum Mechanics</h2>

    <p>
        Quantum mechanics has led to numerous technological advancements, including the development of quantum computers, quantum cryptography, and advancements in medical imaging and materials science.
